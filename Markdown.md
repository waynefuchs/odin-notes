# Markdown

While markdown is not complicated, these resources really helped me get started and taught me what formatting is possible. Using markdown to take notes almost forces "good" note-taking habits. I'm not claiming to have the best notes, at all, but what I _am_ saying is that the quality of my notes improved when I started using markdown.
