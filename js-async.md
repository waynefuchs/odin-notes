# JavaScript Asynchronous Code

## Resources

* [Avoid Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com/)
  * Keep your code shallow (name anonymouse functions and separate them)
  * Modularlize (write lots of small packages that do one thing well)
  * Handle every single error (a linter like `standard` helps)

## Callback

A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

An example of a callback is the function passed to `addEventListener`.
