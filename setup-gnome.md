# â“˜ Application Launcher

I needed to add some command line options to a few applications in gnome.

I found an [Ask Ubuntu Question](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1255750/how-can-i-tell-which-app-is-coming-from-which-source-in-gnome) that told me where to find the "shortcut" or "launcher" or *.desktop files.

It turns out that wayland and my rtx 3070 just aren't going to work, though. So I solved my issue by reverting to X11 at the login screen. (bottom right after choosing a user)

# Gnome Settings

Fix things that annoy me in Gnome

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# mousing over a window gives it focus
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-mode 'sloppy'

# disable delaying focus change
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter focus-change-on-pointer-rest false

# set the desktop background color
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background color-shading-type 'solid'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri ''
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri-dark ''
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background primary-color '#2d2d30'

# set up desktop switching shortcuts
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-right "['<Control><Alt>Right', '<Control><Super>Right']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-left "['<Control><Alt>Left', '<Control><Super>Left']"

# Allow VSCode ctrl-alt-shift-[up/down] line-duplication to work
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-down '[]'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-up '[]'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-down '[]'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-up '[]'
```


# dconf-editor

I just use gsettings now. But dconf-editor can be handy if you want to look through gnome settings. And I can't ever remember what it's called.

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install dconf-editor

# Fedora
dconf-editor
```
