# Physical

Physical disabilities (motor disabilities) include

- weakness
- limitations of muscular control
  - involuntary movements
  - tremors
  - lack of coordination
  - paralysis
- limitations of sensation
- joint disorders (such as arthritis)
- pain that impedes movement
- missing limbs

## Guidelines

> Note: People with cognitive and visual disabilities may also benefit from these guidelines

- Design for people using only a mouse or only a keyboard (or analogue)
- Provide full keyboard support (shortcuts, navigation, etc)
- Provide ample time to type, click, or carry out interactions (especially forms)
- Users may not be able to "chord" keys, and may only be able to press a single key at a time (not `ctrl+s` for example)
- Provide large clickable areas
- Provide error correction options (especially for forms)
- Provide visible indication of the current focus
- Provide mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as page headers and navigation bars
- Provide Consistent, Predictable, and simple navigation mechanisms and page functions
