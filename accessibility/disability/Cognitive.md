# Cognitive, Learning, and Neurological

## Guidelines

- Content that is clearly structured and facilitates overview and orientation
  - Avoid complex page layouts (or provide simple layouts)
  - Avoid complex sentences and unusual words
  - Allow web browser controls to adapt page design or allow custom css
- Consistency in labeling forms, buttons, and content
- Predictable link targets, function, and interaction
- Multiple ways of navigating websites
  - hierarchial menu
  - search
  - Avoid complex navigation mechanisms
- Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, animation, audio, music, and distracting content
- simpler text, supplemented by images, graphs, and illustrations
  - Avoid long passages of text without images, graphs, or illustrations to highlight context
- grammar and spelling tools, used by CLN individuals require developers to consider web accessibility requirements which are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.
