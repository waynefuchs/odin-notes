## Auditory Guidelines

- transcripts and captions of audio content
- media players that display captions
- provide options to adjust the **text size** and **text color** of captions
- provide playback options for audio content (stop, pause, skip back, skip forward, volume)
- high-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise or music
- provide alternatives to voice-only content
- To make web content more understandable to many people:
  - Providing simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and illustrations
  - (and, where possible) Provide important information in sign language
    - Sign language may be preferable / primary language (and the individual may not read as well as they can sign)
