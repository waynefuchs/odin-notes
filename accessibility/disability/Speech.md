# Speech

Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software.

## Guidelines

- Provide some manner of company contact (eg: e-mail or chat) and not just a phone number or voice service
- Don't limit user interface interaction to voice command (as cool as that could be)

| Disability                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Apraxia of speech (AOS)** | inconsistent articulation and production of speech sounds, and errors producing sounds in the correct order making spoken words and phrases difficult to understand.                                |
| **Cluttering**              | includes increased speaking rate, incorrect rhythm, intonation, and co-articulation of sounds, and other influent speech that is sometimes similar to stuttering.                                   |
| **Dysarthria**              | Weakness or complete paralysis of muscles that are necessary to produce speech, including lips, lungs, throat, tongue, and others.                                                                  |
| **Speech sound disorder**   | Inability to produce certain sounds or patterns of sound and sometimes results in addition, distortion, omission, or substitution of such sounds with others.                                       |
| **Stuttering**              | influent (not flowing) speech, repetition of individual sounds or entire words and phrases, and misplacement or prolongation of pauses and sounds while speaking that is different from cluttering. |
