## WCAG Four Principles:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction the user cannot perform.
3. **Understandable**: Users must be able to understand the information or user interface that is presented. (Including bad error messages, such as "ERROR 113: ID-10T")
4. **Robust**: Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and other user agents, and must remain accessible as those technologies advance.

## WCAG Conformance Levels

- Level A: Essential support (The bare minium)
- Level AA: Ideal Support (What most sites strive to achieve)
- Level AAA: Specialized Support (Not recommended for most sites as some content makes this level impossible to reach)
