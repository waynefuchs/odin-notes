# Images

## [Alternative Text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)

The `alt` attribute should typically:

- be **accurate and equivalent** in representing content and function
- **be succinct**
  - Content (if any) and function (if any) should be presented as succinctly as possible, without sacrificing accuracy.
  - Typically, only a few words are necessary, though rarely a short sentence or two may be appropriate.
- **not be redundant** or provide the same information as text located near the image
- **not include phrases like "image of ..." or "graphic of ...", etc**
  - This would be redundant since screen readers already announce "graphic" along with the alt text.
  - If the fact that an image is a photograph or illustration, etc. is important content, it may be useful to include this information in alternative text.
