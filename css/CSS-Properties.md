# CSS Properties

This should probably get pulled into CSS-Reference....

I have taken generalized notes on most of this already. Having good access to docs is important, though. For those times that google doesn't come through. Or to get a link to something that you've already read and have familiarity with. Idk. Just typing this stuff out and spending a minute or two looking through each of these is helping solidify this stuff? Who am I convincing. This is is a private repo. I think.
