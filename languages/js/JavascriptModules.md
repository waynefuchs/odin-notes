## Concepts

### Closure

### Prototypes

The way to set object inheritance in JS/ES.

- Never use call `setPrototypeOf()` directly in production code, this prevents the JS engine from optimizing your program!! It can be helpful in testing things, but in general.. AVOID
  - ~~`Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, inheritedProtoObject)`: How to set the prototype~~
- Object.getPrototypeOf()
- `obj.hasOwnProperty("property")` returns true if the property is stored in the referenced object

### Lesson: Objects and Object Constructors

> Personal Comments
>
> I got to the end of reading the following lesson for the third time, and realized I needed to come back and review this lesson as well. The Odin Project states that it is imperative that this information be completely understood at this level.

- Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.

  ```js
  function Constructor(name, value) {
    this.name = name;
    this.value = value;
  }
  const property = new Constructor("the meaning of life", 42);
  console.log(property.name); // "the meaning of life"
  console.log(property.value); // 42
  ```

- Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.

  `prototype` in javascript is a linked list (chain) of inheritance.

- Explain prototypal inheritance.

  An object's prototype points to another `object (scope)` all the way until you reach the root / global scope. Each scope is tested for variables (including functions / methods) all the way up the chain/list.

- Understand the basic do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt‚Äôs of prototypical inheritance.

  The following example was given in The Odin Project lesson.

  ```js
  function Student() {}

  Student.prototype.sayName = function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  };

  function EighthGrader(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.grade = 8;
  }

  EighthGrader.prototype = Object.create(Student.prototype);

  const carl = new EighthGrader("carl");
  carl.sayName(); // console.logs "carl"
  carl.grade; // 8
  ```

  DO:

  - Use Object.create() to assign prototype / inheritance (`ObjectA.prototype = Object.create(ObjectB.prototype);`)

  DO NOT (NEVER):

  - Manually set prototype (`objA.prototype = objB.prototype;`)
  - Attempt to loop a chain
  - Use `setPrototypeOf()`

- Explain what Object.create does

  `Object.create()` allows the programmer to create an object which will delegate to another object on failed lookups. (scope)

  ```js
  // This code is a bit of an aside.
  // But it demonstrates Object.create()
  // And how it relates to the `new` keyword
  function Animal(name, energy) {
    // const this = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
    this.name = name;
    this.energy = energy;
    // return this
  }
  const leo = new Animal("Leo", 7);
  ```

- How does `this` behave in different situations?

  This article [Gentle Explanation of "this" in JavaScript](https://dmitripavlutin.com/gentle-explanation-of-this-in-javascript/) begins to tackle this answer, and it only takes about 30 pages.

### Factory Functions and the Module Pattern

> Personal Comments:
>
> For whatever reason I really struggled with this lesson.

- Describe common bugs you might run into using constructors.

  1. Can inadvertently introduce bugs into your code
  2. They look like regular functions, but do not behave as such
  3. If you forget the `new` keyboard, you can introduce difficult to trace bugs (eg: related to global scope)

- Write a factory method that returns an object.

  ```js
  const hitchhikerFactory = (name, meaning) => {
    const whatIs = () => {
      console.log(`The meaning of ${name} is ${meaning}`);
    };
    return { name, meaning, whatIs };
  };
  let hitchhiker = hitchhikerFactory("life, the universe, and everything", 42);
  hitchhiker.whatIs(); // The meaning of life, the universe, and everything is 42
  ```

- Explain how scope works in JavaScript (bonus points if you can point out what ES6 changed!).

  Simply: Scope is just a measure of what variables are available to your program at the point a line is executed. The addition of `const` and `let` in addition to the original `var` keywords are what changed.

  - `var`: Scope is `global` or `functional`.
  - `let` and `const`: Scope is `global`, `functional`, or `block`. NEW IN ES6

- Explain what Closure is and how it impacts private functions & variables.

  A closure is the combination of a function, bundled together with references to its surrounding state. (lexical environment)

  ```js
  function makeAdder(x) {
    return function (y) {
      return x + y;
    };
  }

  const add5 = makeAdder(5);
  const add10 = makeAdder(10);

  console.log(add5(2)); // 7
  console.log(add10(2)); // 12
  ```

- Describe how private functions & variables are useful.

  Removing the ability for tampering with unnecessary internal program variables and details makes for less bug-prone and easily testable code.

- Use inheritance in objects using the factory pattern.

  ```js
  const createAnimal = (type) => {
    const sayType = () => console.log(`I am a(n) ${type}!`);
    return { sayType };
  };
  const createCow = (type) => {
    const { sayType } = createAnimal("Cow");
    const sayMoo = () => console.log("Moo.");
    return { sayType, sayMoo };
  };
  const betsy = createCow();
  betsy.sayType();
  betsy.sayMoo();
  ```

- Describe IIFE. What does it stand for?

  An IIFE is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

- Explain the module pattern.

  It's the factory pattern, except it is immediately invoked (IIFE) instead of being used to create multiple objects.

  ```js
  let calculator = (() => {
    let name = "Calculator";
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
    const sayName = () =>
      console.log(`${name} - ${typeof a === "undefined" ? "none" : a}`);
    const setName = (a) => (name = a);
    return { add, subtract, sayName, setName };
  })();
  console.log(calculator.add(1, 3)); // 4
  calculator.sayName(); // Calculator - none
  calculator.setName("Hairbrush");
  calculator.sayName(); // Hairbrush - none
  ```

- Briefly explain namespacing and how it‚Äôs useful.

  Namespacing is the separation of naming scope, where you can specify two functions in the same program with the same name.

  Example: A calculator module that benefits from having an 'add()' function, and also a UI progress bar that benefits from being able to 'add()' progress. This is possible as long as you don't have namespace collisions.

### Classes

```javascript
// Here is an example of what a class looks like
class MyClass {
  prop = value; // property

  constructor(...) { // constructor
    // ...
  }

  method(...) {} // method

  get something(...) {} // getter method
  set something(...) {} // setter method

  [Symbol.iterator]() {} // method with computed name (symbol here)
  // ...
}
```

- Describe the pros and cons of using classes in JavaScript.

  Pros:

  - ES6 `class` adds a standard (looking) OOP feature

  Cons:

  - Isn't actually a "class"
  - Doesn't work with functional programming

- Briefly discuss how JavaScript‚Äôs object creation differs from a language like Java or Ruby.

  In other OOP languages, the class is used as a structure for their objects. In JS, objects don't really have structure, they are just bits of combined and referenced data.

- Explain the differences between using a class to define a constructor and other prototype methods.

  - Classes have the internal property `[[IsClassConstructor]]: true;`
  - Classes are non-enumerable
  - Classes always `use strict`

  - Classes are not hoisted. Javascript does something called "hoisting," where declarations are moved to the top of their scope prior to code execution.
  - Classes allow the definition of `static` methods. (no access to `this` and are run in `"use strict"` mode)
  - Class fields (same as properties, except for the declaration) can be _public_ (`height = 0;`) or _private_ (`#height = 7;` or `this.#height = constructorHeight;` if declared inside a class method).
  - Classes can be extended. (`class Dog extends Animal;`) Classes can extend constructable objects in addition to classes.
  - Use of the `super` keyword to do super calls is allowed. In example, you can call `super.method()` to gain access to the extended class's method. This is not possible with prototype-based inheritance.
  - Classes can not be redefined. Doing so throws an error.

- Explain what ‚Äúgetters‚Äù & ‚Äúsetters‚Äù are.

  Getters and setters are methods that modify fields/properties in a class, allowing for more than just the variable adjustment to take place. (For example, updating the UI along with the variable update.)

  They also allow public access to private fields to protect tampering.

- Understand what computed names and class fields are.

  Computed names are a way to use a variable as a method name. `method = "method"; ['this' + 'Is' + 'A' + method]() {alert("not a security risk at all... /s");}`

  Class fields are class properties that are defined in the class body. Defining them at the top of the class can help to make the code more self documenting.

  Class properties _must_ be defined in methods.

- Describe function binding.

  You can use `bind()` to create a "bound variant" of a function, meaning that even if the object changes, the original function will be called. This is especially useful when dealing with input events and timers.

- Be able to use inheritance with classes.

  This is just being able to use the `extends` and `super` keywords, like so:

  ```javascript
  class Cat {
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
      console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
    }
  }

  class Lion extends Cat {
    speak() {
      super.speak();
      console.log(`${this.name} roars.`);
    }
  }

  const l = new Lion("Fuzzy");
  l.speak();
  // Fuzzy makes a noise.
  // Fuzzy roars.
  ```

- Briefly talk about the conflict in JS with functional programming and classes.

  In JavaScript, classes are not enumerable. Functional programming requires enumerable objects. This means that you can not directly use classes in functional programming.
