# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a _declarative programming_ paradigm. A declarative programming paradigm is the description of what you want to do, rather than how; or the definition of logic rather than control flow.

It is almost easier to define what functional programming isn't. See: [Functional Javascript](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript).

Requirements for functional programming

1. Functions must be **first class** citizens, meaning functions can be bound to names, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions just like any other data type. This is the computer science concept that is approximately equivalent to the mathematical calculus "higher order function" concept.
2. Functions must be pure. (fixed output for fixed input; no mutated state)
3.
