# The Odin Project

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a coding bootcamp created by Erik Trautman in 2013 to help people develop the skills to be job-ready for full stack web developer positions.

# This "Odin-Notes" Project

This is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) containing random bits and pieces of information that I am assembling in a centralized personal repository on web development.

A large part of the information here is me writing what I learned in my own words to help solidify the knowledge. That means that sometimes, for example when I already know something, I may not write it down. What I'm trying to say is that this documentation does not contain "everything you need to know about web development." You'll want to check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for that resource.

With that out of the way, I am regularly reviewing the information here. Specifically, there are notes to myself (TODO) throughout this project that I periodically review and resolve as I become more experienced with various parts of the tech stack, or if I find that I'm referencing a specific file frequently.
