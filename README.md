# The Odin Project

[Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

Notes I made while studying through TOP. (The Odin Project)

The project states that students are not expected to take notes, but I find that I learn a whole lot more efficiently if I write things down. And Then I also know exactly where to go back and look things up when I can't quite remember some specific syntax, or whatever. And if I find that I didn't record that piece that I can't remember, which is more often than not the case, then I just add that bit in. Then another time or two of looking that bit up, and I have it committed to memory.
