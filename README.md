# The Odin Project

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a coding bootcamp created by Erik Trautman in 2013 to help people develop the skills to be job-ready and transition into a full stack web developer position.

I started The Odin Project on May 22, 2022, and this repo is a collection of notes on web development.
