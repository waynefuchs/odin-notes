I have started a "Design" section where I can start putting UI/UX design info.

But there has to be a better way than manuall coming up with UI colors. Maybe not. It sure takes _(me)_ a long time.

# Color Palette

2. Supporting Colors
   - Used to draw attention or communicate using color
   - Usage: `Error Messages`, `Confirmation`, `Informational Dialogs`
3. Neutrals
   - Usage: `Text`, `Backgrounds`, `Border Colors`, `Secondary Buttons`

# Colors

Attempt at a description for what colors are required in a UI.

## Brand Colors

Brand Colors are used throughout a website as "splashes of color" to determine the feel of the site. A good example of this is "facebook blue" which makes the app "feel blue" even though most of the app is "grace"

One or Two colors

-
- Usage: `Buttons`, `Links`, `Icons`, `Navigation`

### Number of Brand Colors

| #   | Effect                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Clean, but could be considered sterile    |
| 2   | Can be good, depending on design elements |
| 3+  | Entering Chaotic territory                |

The brand colors usually come from the business; and will likely have been chosen at the time the company developed their branding package. If there is no branding available, here are some tips to choose 'Brand Color' for UI/UX.

### Should be a "middle color"

A "middle color" is a color that has strong saturation and value. (from the highlighted region)

### Should pass the "background test"

A brand color should work well as a button background color.

## Supporting Colors (4 colors)

Supporting colors are used in dialog messages and icons to easily convey information to the user in a universal manner.

Color should not be the _only_ way that this information is conveyed, but things like red text in a form is pretty universal for "Something you entered is wrong in the terms of what this form was expecting."

1. Success Color: Usually a (Green) is needed
2. Warning Color: Usually a (Yellow or Orange)
3. Error Color: Usually a (Red)
4. Info Color: Usually a (Blue) for neutral informational messages

Supporting colors need to feel like they go along with your brand colors. Pay attention to saturation and brightness levels (HSV) in comparison to the brand colors. Both values (S & B) should be within 5 or 10 of the brand color. Once you have the S and B set, you can adjust the hue to be whatever you like.

## Neutral (3 colors)

I like to tint my neutrals towards the brand color(s), slightly.

- Dark (near black)
- Gray (near midpoint)
- Light (near white)

```css
/* example variable names */
:root {
  --c-dark: black;
  --c-mid: gray;
  --c-light: white;
}
```
