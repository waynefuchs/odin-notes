# Color Palette

1. Brand Colors
   - One or Two colors
   - Used throughout the site, as "splashes of color" to determine the feel of the site. A good example of this is "facebook blue" which makes the app "feel blue" even though most of the app is "grace"
   - Usage: `Buttons`, `Links`, `Icons`, `Navigation`
2. Supporting Colors
   - Used to draw attention or communicate using color
   - Usage: `Error Messages`, `Confirmation`, `Informational Dialogs`
3. Neutrals
   - Usage: `Text`, `Backgrounds`, `Border Colors`, `Secondary Buttons`

# Brand Colors

The brand colors usually come from the business; and will likely have been chosen at the time the company developed their branding package. If there is no branding available, as you will find for small businesses, here are some tips to build a 'Brand Color' for UI/UX.

Choose a good "middle color(s)" for your 'Brand Color(s)'

This is a color that your lighter and darker colors will be based on.

- This color will usually come from the upper right of a standard RGB color picker.

- This color works well as a button background color

3. Error Color: Usually a (Red)

# HSB Color Picker

Use the HSB color picker when choosing colors for UI/UX, as it gives "finer control" over colors in a more understandable way.

> `H` Hue (1-365):
>
> A number that defines color values, all the way around the color wheel

> `S` Saturation (0-100):
>
> How intense the color is on a percentage scale

> `B` Brightness (1-100)
>
> How much black or white is being added to the color on a percentage scale. Anything over 50 will have white added, anything under 50 will have black added.
