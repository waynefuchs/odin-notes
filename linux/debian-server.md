# Debian <!-- omit in toc -->

The second oldest linux distribution, only behind Slackware. A server OS that is as close to "set and forget" as possible.

# Installation

When going through the install process, there is a screen that shows "Software Selection." Make sure that all graphical packages are deselected, and you want an ssh server and standard system utilities.

- [ ] Debian Desktop Environment
  - [ ] ...Gnome
- [ ] web server
- [x] SSH server
- [x] standard system utilities

# Transfer SSH key

On your local system, put the host dns or ip address of the remote host into the `REMOTEHOST` variable.

```bash
export REMOTEHOST={HostnameOrIp}
```

Then copy and paste the following in the window. You will be prompted for your password, twice.

```bash
ssh $REMOTEHOST mkdir .ssh
scp ~/.ssh/xeno_ed25519.pub $REMOTEHOST:.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh $REMOTEHOST 'chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh $REMOTEHOST
```

## Packages

Log In with user account, **not root**

```bash
su  # Log in to root from a user account for the sudo group step below
```

```bash
apt install sudo vim htop figlet
```

## Add user to sudo group

```bash
/sbin/adduser $USER sudo
```

Log out and in again to refresh the ssh group, cleanly.

## Remove grub 5 second delay

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_TIMEOUT=5/GRUB_TIMEOUT=0/g' /etc/default/grub
```

# Software

This is subject to change, but I currently use Debian as a server platform. That means there isn't a whole lot of software to install, mostly just docker images, and then yaml writing and configuring.

## Docker

Docker has a [set of instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) on their website to install on Debian.

# Update MOTD

Remove the standard MOTD and replace with a "pretty" motd.

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/sed -i d /etc/motd
sudo rm -f /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname
echo -e '#!/usr/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/figlet -kp < /etc/hostname\nif [[ $HOSTNAME =~ [g|j|p|q] ]]; then /usr/bin/echo ""; fi' |sudo tee /etc/update-motd.d/00-hostname
sudo /usr/bin/chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/00-hostname
```

# Mount Samba

If you want to mount samba shares, you need to install `cifs-utils`

```bash
sudo apt install cifs-utils
```

Then, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`

```bash
# This will allow read and write..
# NEED TO SET:
#   HOST: octarine.xeno.org
#   SHARE: www-data
#   USERNAME: grok  (this is local user, not samba user)
#   GROUPNAME: grok (this is local group, not samba group)
#   FILEMODE:
#     444: Read Only
#     764: User RWX, Group RW, Other R
//HOST/SHARE	/mount/point/dir		cifs	guest,uid=USERNAME,gid=GROUPNAME,file_mode=FILEMODE	0	0
```

# ðŸš§ OS Hardening

Debian ships, by default, with a few questionable security settings. (such as, an enabled root user)

I am in the process of writing a script to harden debian. I'll put it here when I finish.
