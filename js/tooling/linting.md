# Linting

Linters help you find and fix problems before they are a problem, as you write code. It enforces rules in a code base.

A linter is slow and should not be used to change your code. For that task, a code formatter such as [Prettier](./prettier.md) should be used.

## Linters

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)
