    <h2>aria-label</h2>
    <p>
      Avoid using this attribute where possible, as the accessible text
      presented to the user may not be available on the screen for sighted
      users.

        There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as
        yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best
        of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never
        come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
        And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago,
        fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
      </p>
      <p>
        We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
        and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
        hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
        our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are
        willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we
        intend to win, and the others, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift
        our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important
        decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the
        Presidency.

        In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the
        greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the
        ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1
        booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John
        Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their
        accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket
        engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn
        combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn
        missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as
        tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as
        two lengths of this field.

        The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk,
        240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that little thing held so
        many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests,
        famines, wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced
        that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, coming from some other part
        of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited
        at all. But the sam wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively
        that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on
        it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground,
        water, air, clouds, floating around in space. From out there it really
        is 'one world'.

        The most significant things we can think about, when we think about
        Apollo, is that it has opened for us, for us being the World, a
        challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of
        that future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young
        people all over the world. Learning to live and learning to work
        together. In order to remind all the peoples of the World, in so many
        countries throughout the world, that this is what we all are striving
        for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical
        of what we have here in the valley of Taurus L i t t r o w. It's a rock
        composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably
        from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of
        all sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors
        that have grown together to become a cohesive rock outlasting the nature
        of Space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful
        manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like it to
        Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of the
        countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of
        what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are, and
        a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the future.
